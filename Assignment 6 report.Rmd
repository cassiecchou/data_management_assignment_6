```{r Example Chunk, echo=FALSE}

# Open wws03 file 
load(file="wws03.RData") 

#Let's create an example chunk, to grab the date and save it in run.date :

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. 

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 

In the next line of text, notice that there is R code that is replaced with the actual output of the command. The ** characters make the text **bold**. 

This report is for all data collected as of **`r run.date`**.  

**Cohort Summary**  
There are there are a total of **`r nrow(wws03)`** women in our study. The mean age is **`r round(mean(wws03$age), 1)`** years and **`r nrow(wws03[wws03$married==1,])`** are married.


*You can embed an R code chunk like this with echo=TRUE and it will display the R code followed by the output:*
```{r Barplot Age Distribution, echo=TRUE}
counts <- table(wws03$age)
barplot(counts, main="Age Distribution", xlab = "Age in years")
```


*The next R code chunk is not displayed because echo=FALSE. Only the output is displayed.*
```{r Boxplot Pulse by Age, echo=FALSE}
boxplot(wws03$plavg ~ wws03$age, ylab = "Average Pulse" ,xlab = "Age (years)", main="Average Pulse by Age")

```

**Here is a table created using pander**  
```{r Pander Table College Grad by Marital Stat, results = 'asis', echo=FALSE}

wws03$collgrad <- factor(wws03$collgrad,
                            levels=c(0,1),
                            labels=c("no","yes"))

wws03$married <- factor(wws03$married,
                            levels=c(0,1),
                            labels=c("no","yes"))


required.packages <- c("descr","pander","dplyr","knitr")
packages.to.install <- setdiff(required.packages, installed.packages())
if(length(packages.to.install) > 0) install.packages(packages.to.install)

library(descr)
library(pander)
pander(CrossTable(wws03$collgrad,wws03$married, digits = 1, prop.c = FALSE, 
                  prop.t = FALSE, chisq = FALSE, prop.chisq = FALSE, row.labels = TRUE, dnn = c("College Graduate","Married"))) 

```

**Here is a table created with kable**  
```{r Table made with kable, results = 'asis', echo=FALSE}

# Load dplyr and instruct it not to give any messages because these will appear in the output.
library(dplyr,quietly = TRUE,warn.conflicts = FALSE)

# Create a data frame of participants with bpavg > 130 and return the specified columns.
data <- wws03[wws03$bpavg > 130, c(1:2,31:35,42)]
# Sort the data by bpavg in desc order
data <- arrange(data,desc(bpavg))

# Load knitr and instruct it not to give any messages because these will appear in the output.
library(knitr,quietly = TRUE,warn.conflicts = FALSE)

# Print the table using kable
kable(data,row.names = FALSE,col.names = c("Participant ID","Age","BP1","BP2","BP3","BP4","BP5","BP Average"))
